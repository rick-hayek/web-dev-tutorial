# Use webpack for bundling web assets

## Prerequisites

You need to finish the tutorial [setup a minimal node based web app](placeholder)

## Initializing

From terminal, issue commands:

```bash
mkdir 2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets
cd 2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets
npm init -y
```

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`, issue commands:

```bash
mkdir src
cd src
touch index.js
```

Modify `index.js` as:

```javascript
console.log("Hello webpack!");
```

## Setting up webpack

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`:

```bash
npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Update `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
  },
```

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets\`:

```bash
npm run build
```

You will find that a new file `\dist\main.js` is generated based on the original source `\src\index.js`.

## Using webpack development tool

webpack-dev-server is itself an expressÂ server which can serve the bundle and additionally handles hot module replacement (HMR).

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`:

```bash
npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev
touch webpack.config.js
```

And initialize `webpack.config.js` as:

```javascript
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: path.join(__dirname, "dist")
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: "./dist",
    port: 3002
  }
};
```

Then add `start` command to `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack",
    "start": "webpack && webpack-dev-server --open"
  },
```

Run `npm start`. You will see browser is launched and is navigated to <http://localhost:3002/>. The home page displays the contents of `./dist/` as we haven't really defined an HTML home page.

## Serving static HTML page

webpack needs additional components to deal with HTML files: [html-webpack-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin) and [html-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/html-loader).

> A [loader](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/) does preprocessing transformation of files with a specified file format **before** the bundle is generated. For example, a [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) transforms Type-Script to JavaScript.
>
> A [plugin](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins) will do everything that a loader cannot do. It works at bundle or chunk level, and usually work at the end of the bundle generation process.

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`, issue commands:

```bash
cd src
mkdir public
cd public
touch index.html
```

Modify `index.html` as:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello web app</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`, issue commands:

```bash
npm i html-webpack-plugin html-loader --save-dev
```

Add following content to `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  ...,

  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(html)$/,
        use: [{ loader: "html-loader" }]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
      template: "./src/public/index.html", // source html file
      filename: "./index.html" // resulting html file name
    })
  ]
};
```

Now run `npm start`. You will find the bundle script is injected to the resulting HTML file. And this home page gets served.
