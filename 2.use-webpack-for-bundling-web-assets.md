# Use webpack for bundling web assets

## Prerequisites

You need to finish the tutorial [setup a minimal node based web app](https://github.com/rick-hayek/web-dev-tutorial/blob/master/1.setup-a-minimal-node-based-web-app.md)

## Initializing

From terminal, issue commands:

```bash
mkdir 2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets
cd 2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets
npm init -y
```

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`, issue commands:

```bash
mkdir src
cd src
touch index.js
```

Modify `index.js` as:

```javascript
console.log("Hello webpack!");
```

**Note:** the all shell commands below are issued from directory `<your-working-directory>/2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/` unless explicitly specified.

## Setting up webpack

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`:

```bash
npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
```

Update `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack"
  },
```

From terminal run:

```bash
npm run build
```

You will find that a new file `\dist\main.js` is generated based on the original source `\src\index.js`.

## Using webpack development tool

webpack-dev-server is itself an expressÂ server which can serve the bundle and additionally handles hot module replacement (HMR).

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`:

```bash
npm i webpack-dev-server --save-dev
touch webpack.config.js
```

And initialize `webpack.config.js` as:

```javascript
const path = require("path");

module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",
    path: path.join(__dirname, "dist")
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: "./dist",
    port: 3002
  }
};
```

Then add `start` command to `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "build": "webpack",
    "start": "webpack && webpack-dev-server --open"
  },
```

Run `npm start`. You will see browser is launched and is navigated to <http://localhost:3002/>. The home page displays the contents of `./dist/` as we haven't really defined an HTML home page.

## Serving static HTML page

webpack needs additional components to deal with HTML files: [html-webpack-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin) and [html-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/html-loader).

> A [loader](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/) does preprocessing transformation of files with a specified file format **before** the bundle is generated. For example, a [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) transforms Type-Script to JavaScript.
>
> A [plugin](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins) will do everything that a loader cannot do. It works at bundle or chunk level, and usually work at the end of the bundle generation process.

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`, issue commands:

```bash
cd src
mkdir public
cd public
touch index.html
```

Modify `index.html` as:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Web App</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>web app</h1>
    <div id="app">Welcome to web development</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

From terminal while in directory `2.use-webpack-for-bundling-web-assets/`, issue commands:

```bash
npm i html-webpack-plugin html-loader --save-dev
```

Add following content to `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  ...,

  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(html)$/,
        use: [{ loader: "html-loader" }]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
      template: "./src/public/index.html", // source html file
      filename: "./index.html" // resulting html file name
    })
  ]
};
```

Now run `npm start`. You will find the bundle script is injected to the resulting HTML file. And this home page gets served.

## Processing CSS

### Importing css from javascript

To `import` or `require` a style file, we need to install _css-loader_:

```bash
npm i css-loader --save-dev
```

Configure it in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...,
      {
        test: /\.(css)$/,
        use: [
          { loader: "css-loader"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
```

Now you are allowed to import css in a javascript file:

```javascript
import from "./style/main.css";
import style1 from "./style/myStyle.css";
const anotherStyle = require("./style/anotherStyle.css");
```

Try it:

```bash
cd src
mkdir style
cd style
touch index.css
```

Add any valid styles into `index.css`, and then reference it from the entry `./src/index.js`:

```javascript
import "./style/index.css";

console.log("Hello webpack!");
```

Run `npm run build` to check if sources can be built successfully. For comparison, you can delete the css rule from `webpack.config.js`, then run `npm run build`. Should get errors.

_Note, if running `npm start`, you may find the css doesn't take effect as it isn't actually used in HTML file._

### Using style files

#### Inline styles

Use `style-loader` to inject css contents into `<style>` tag:

```bash
npm i style-loader --save-dev
```

Configure it in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...,
      {
        test: /\.(css)$/,
        use: [
          { loader: "style-loader"},
          { loader: "css-loader"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
```

Create a sample css file:

```bash
cd src
cd style
touch inline.css
```

Add some valid styles to `inline.css`. Then reference it from entry point `index.js`:

```js
import "./style/index.css";
import inlineStyle from "./style/inline.css";

console.log(inlineStyle);
console.log("Hello webpack!");
```

Run `npm start`, you will find:

- There's no injected `<style>` tag s from the resulting `./dist/index.html`
- All styles are applied (in runtime) when you browse <http://localhost:3002/>

#### Generating external css file

Inline style usually is not a good idea for a complex production web application. We should reference external css file from `<link>` tag. The plugin `mini-css-extract-plugin` will extract all css contents from all `.css` files, and write them into a single output css file, then inject the reference to `<link>` tag of resulting HTML file.

```bash
npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
```

Configure it in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");
module.exports = {
  ...,
  module: {
    rules: [
      ...,
      {
        test: /\.(css)$/,
        use: [
          { loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader},
          { loader: "css-loader"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    ...,
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: "main.css" // resulting stylesheet file
    })
  ],
```

Run `npm start`:

- A `./dist/main.css` is created as resulting stylesheet file
- `main.css` is referenced by the resulting `index.html` in `<link>` tag
- All styles are correctly applied when you browse <http://localhost:3002/>

#### Using sass file

To support **sass** file, install `sass-loader` and `node-sass`:

```bash
npm i sass-loader node-sass --save-dev
```

Add `sass-loader` into the existing style configuration block in `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
  {
    test: [/\.css$|\.scss$/],
    use: [
      { loader: MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader},
      'css-loader',
      'sass-loader'
    ]
  }
```

## Processing image

The [file-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/file-loader) resolves `import/require()` on a file into a url and emits the file into the output directory:

```bash
npm install file-loader --save-dev
```

Update `webpack.config.js` to add rule for image files:

```javascript
{
  test: /\.(png|jpg|gif|svg)$/,
  use: [
    {
      loader: 'file-loader',
      options: {
        name: '[name].[hash:8].[ext]'
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Then you can import image from a js file like this:

```javascript
import logo from "path/to/image/logo.png";
```

Let's try it.

```bash
cd src
mkdir image
```

Find an image file, and save it in `./src/image` folder. Then include it from entry point `./src/index.js`:

Update `index.js` as:

```javascript
...
import background from "./image/beach-exotic-holiday.jpg";

console.log(background);
var img = document.createElement("img");
img.src = background;

var container = document.getElementById("app");
container.appendChild(img);
```

Build and run the application to check if image works.
